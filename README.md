# Jar of Life!

Project that I decided to opensource for no specific reason but just to make it available in case someone around wants to contribute or make it its own. Its based around the concept of Rocks, Pebbles and Sand that can fit a jar, and its analogy to anyone's life. Check here for an explanation (or check Google for countless info on it): [https://www.criterionconferences.com/blog/professional-development/rocks-pebbles-sand/](link)

## Develop

Simply:
```
npm install
```

## Run

```
npm start
```

It will start a development server using Webpack.


## ToDo

Deployment and running in Production are still pending.
